## Concept

Display US crop insurance indemnities by county for 1979 to 2017. Losses due to declines in price, hail, and earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes have been excluded from this accounting as having little to do with soil health or function.

You have many years experience looking at graphs on paper but only a few years experience looking at graphs on phones and tablets. Given that you are likely to increase your time looking at your phone in the future, we must consider the shape of the graphs to come.

Thus a particular motivation here is to display the data in a fun and lively manner in order to encourage you to manipulate the model and gain new insights.

A globe is a useful reminder that the US is just a small part of the earth and that future revisions could consider the numbers over the entire Earth.


## To Do / Wish List

This is a first pass at displaying the data. Further revisions might add more data

* Arable acres per county is added to data set; indemnity per acre is displayed
* Current year color indicates the difference with a moving averages pf the data
* Rainfall or other weather difference with moving average is indicated
* Crop types and acres of crop areas are indicated
* Legends and colors developed in more detail
* Popups display statistics such as average and total indemnity for the entire rand and or decade
* Data from more recent years is added
* Data for all states and territories is added
* Data is grabbed at load time from original sources
* Entire graphic design and user experience is ameliorated
